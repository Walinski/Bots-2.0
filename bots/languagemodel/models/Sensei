FROM llama3:latest  
# Specifies the model version being used (in this case, llama3's latest version).

# Model parameters
PARAMETER temperature 0.6  
# Controls the randomness of the model's responses. Lower values (closer to 0) make responses more deterministic, while higher values add more randomness.

PARAMETER top_p 0.80  
# Sets the cumulative probability for nucleus sampling. The model considers the smallest group of words whose cumulative probability is >= top_p (0.80 in this case).

PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.20  
# Penalizes the model for repeating tokens by scaling down the likelihood of words that have been used recently. Higher values discourage repetition.

PARAMETER num_ctx 2048
# Defines the context window size, i.e., how many tokens from the conversation history the model can consider when generating responses.

# Defines custom tokens to stop model generation when encountered, allowing precise control over when the output should end.
PARAMETER stop <|start_header_id|>
PARAMETER stop <|end_header_id|>
PARAMETER stop <|eot_id|>  

# Defines the format for system messages, user input, and assistant responses. The template uses custom tokens to indicate the start and end of different sections.
