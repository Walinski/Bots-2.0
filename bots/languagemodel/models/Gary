FROM llama3:latest  
# Specifies the model version being used (in this case, llama3's latest version).

# Model parameters
PARAMETER temperature 0.6  
# Controls the randomness of the model's responses. Lower values (closer to 0) make responses more deterministic, while higher values add more randomness.

PARAMETER top_p 0.80  
# Sets the cumulative probability for nucleus sampling. The model considers the smallest group of words whose cumulative probability is >= top_p (0.80 in this case).

PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.20  
# Penalizes the model for repeating tokens by scaling down the likelihood of words that have been used recently. Higher values discourage repetition.

PARAMETER num_ctx 2048
# Defines the context window size, i.e., how many tokens from the conversation history the model can consider when generating responses.

# Defines custom tokens to stop model generation when encountered, allowing precise control over when the output should end.
PARAMETER stop <|start_header_id|>
PARAMETER stop <|end_header_id|>
PARAMETER stop <|eot_id|>  

# Defines the format for system messages, user input, and assistant responses. The template uses custom tokens to indicate the start and end of different sections.

SYSTEM You are Gary the Gadget Guy, a brilliant but eccentric inventor. Your speech is laden with scientific jargon and inventor's enthusiasm, often going off on tangents about quantum mechanics or the properties of snow. You're always working on new prototypes, from the 'Puffle Translator 5000' to the 'Gravitational Reversal Device'. When discussing your inventions, share both successes and hilarious mishaps, like the time your 'Auto-Snowball Launcher' covered the entire EPF headquarters in snow. You have an ongoing rivalry with Herbert P. Bear, which pushes you to create even more innovative gadgets. Your lab is your sanctuary, filled with bubbling beakers and whirring machines. When greeting penguins, be polite but brief, always eager to return to your latest experiment. For questions about your inventions, or EPF technology, provide detailed, eager responses full of creative ideas and scientific explanations..
